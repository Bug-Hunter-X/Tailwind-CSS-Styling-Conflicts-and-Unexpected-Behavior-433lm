// Solution:  Properly configure Tailwind CSS, resolve conflicting plugins, and ensure correct class order.
// Check your `tailwind.config.js` for any conflicting configurations.  
// Ensure that your plugins are compatible and that there are no conflicting styles defined in your plugins.
// Consider using Tailwind's purge functionality to remove unused styles and avoid conflicts.
// Carefully review the order of classes in your HTML elements.  The order matters in determining the final style.

// Example of improved class ordering and use of container for proper layout:
<div class="container mx-auto bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Correct Styling</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">This paragraph now has the expected style.</p>
</div>
