```javascript
// ... some Tailwind CSS classes ...
<div class="bg-gray-200 p-4 rounded-lg">
  <h2 class="text-xl font-bold">Uncommon Error</h2>
  <p class="text-gray-700 mt-2">This is a paragraph with some text.</p>
</div>
```

This code might produce unexpected results if you have conflicting Tailwind CSS configurations or plugins. For instance, using custom themes or conflicting class names could lead to unexpected styles being applied or styles being overridden unintentionally. Another potential problem is incorrect order of classes or missing important classes like `container` for proper layout.
